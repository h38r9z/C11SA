Here is the assessment   brief:Uncertainty    has    become    the    new    norm    of    the    business    ecosystem    due    to    continuous    disruption   caused   by   man-made crises   and   natural   disasters with serious   effects.   Logistics and   supply   chains   are   among the   most   impacted   business   functions   during   disruption. The   likelihood   and   consequences   of   various    sources    of      risks      are      amplified      by      complex    global      supply      chains,      ever-shrinking      product   lifecycles,   and   unpredictable volatile   markets. This   is   along with   other   mega-trends   including   climate   crisis, shortage of   labour,   and digital disruptions.In   times   of   crisis,   uncertainty   can   reach   extreme   levels,   and   supply   chain   vulnerability   can   be   highly   exposed.   The recent crisis has proven that building resilience and   adaptability   are crucial   during these   periods   of   systemic   change   and   transformation.    It   differentiates    businesses    that    not   only   survive   amidst disruption   but also thrive and   create   business values and   in turn   a   competitive   edge.
